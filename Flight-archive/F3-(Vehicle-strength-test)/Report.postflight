This flight log was written after the fact, before the second ACS presentation.

This flight took place January 4, 2023.

Mission goals were to test the air brakes and recovery. Both were successful, and we caught the air brakes closing on video.
From this mission, we learned that the parachute was too small, and made it bigger.
